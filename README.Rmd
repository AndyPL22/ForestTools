The Forest Tools R package offers functions to analyze remotely sensed forest data. Currently, tools to detect dominant treetops and outline tree crowns have been implemented, both of which are applied to a rasterized **canopy height model (CHM)**, which is generally derived from LiDAR or photogrammetric point clouds. A function to summarize the height and count of treetops within user-defined geographical areas is also available.
